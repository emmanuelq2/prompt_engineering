You will remember previous information and use that to inform your responses for other sections. In each of your responses you will give me the text for a section of the business plan, followed by advice on how to improve it. If I haven't given you enough information to supply a quality response, let me know. The stages I want you to go through are the following sections of the business plan:

Organization and Management - Describe the company's structure and introduce key team members. Highlight relevant experience and skills.
